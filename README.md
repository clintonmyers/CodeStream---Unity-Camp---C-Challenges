# CodeStream---Unity-Camp---C-Challenges

  This repository contains modified versions of complete game files from the Unity tutorial entitled "2-D Roguelike Tutorial" (https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-roguelike-tutorial). The goal of modifying these files was to create individual C# challenges that built upon the fundamentals of object oriented programming learned earlier using learncs.org. Some examples of the challenges are listed below:
  
  - Declaring Variables
  - Writing loops
  - Fixing syntax errors/bugs
  - and more...
